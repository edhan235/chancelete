here is the current homepage, new logo and css file for chanceletes. i would like to make the following changes:

1  make the top nav bar white
2  replace the logo with the attached logo file
3  add the learn more button only below the word HUGE in the hero that scrolls to the next container
4  add a parallax effect on hero so that as you scroll down, it zooms in as if the runner is running towards the viewer
5  fix the hovering button on the bottom of the hero so it's a cool, modern indicator to scroll down
6  Change The Mission to Our Mission and get rid of the image. Instead, use beautiful typography and lines or elegant container in black and white to convey this text:

Student-athletes with a two-way commitment to excellence

Chanceletes.org empowers resource-constrained student-athletes who are willing to work hard, sacrifice and trust the process by investing in the wraparound support needed to reach their fullest potential. In sport and in life.

7  Add a new section with headline: The Problem We Solve and the athlete stack image below.

8  Keep the Who We Serve as is

9  Get rid of the sports we serve section

10 Change The Commitment to Your Commitment

11 Keep the rest as is but animate the scrolling using parallax, fading and other cool interactions as you scroll down.
